Playing Around with Nmap in Python
=================================

Set-up the databse with the following series of steps:
1. Create a new Sqlite db file with this command:
   sqlite3 data.db
The script will assume that you have used this name, and that the file is located in the same directory as the script.
2. You will now see the Sqlite db prompt for this database. Create the table by running the statement found in the repo's create_statement file
